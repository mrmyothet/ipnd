def square(n):
    return n * n
print(square(5))


 # We can write like this
 # def square(n):
    # rerurn n * n
    # x = 3
# print (square(x))

# If you want to get double square, you can write like this.
# def square(n):
    # return n * n
    # x = 3
    # y = square(x)
# print (square(y))
# print(square(square(x))) <-- This is another way.
